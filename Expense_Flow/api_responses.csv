153,CAFE MAYER,"{'displayName': 'Café Mayer', 'primaryType': 'restaurant', 'biz_reviews': ['We had a great experience at Café Mayer in Tel Aviv. The location is central, close to Dizengoff square. The seating was comfortable and not too crowded for a breakfast. The food was delicious and they had vegetarian options which was great. The coffee was also very good. The service was decent and the price was reasonable.\nwould definitely recommend this place', 'We stopped by here for a dessert and we enjoyed it fully. On the menu you can order “Something sweet”. As usual we got 2 different options to be able to share and we were very satisfied.\n\nOur selections were - Chocolate fudge with vanilla ice cream and Lemon and Pistachio Pie. The pie was a layered and a very appetizing option. The fudge was hot. Both portions were big enough for two people to share.\n\nThe cafe has many tables outside and inside. We decided to take a small table inside by the door. That give us an option of enjoying the light night breeze as well.\n\nThe cafe has many options of red and white wines and intriguing salads, shrimp gnocchi and schnitzel and many other appealing options on the menu.\n\nWe will definitely try this place again for a meal date, not just dessert.', 'Amazing service!!\nAmazing food!\nWe started out ordering a bottle of wine , and after that we ordered (with help from the amazing wonderful waiter) amazing dishes. The waiter, Omri, was a part of out outing, always making sure we were happy, gave us shots on the house and then at the end of the evening we ordered a dessert, and because we weren’t 100% happy with the order, gave us another dessert on the house. We had such a wonderful time, we got the Happy Hour discount and some wonderful on the house additions.\nThe service was so nice , fun, and chill.\nWe will definitely come back.', 'This was the first time we ate in Mayer Cafe, and we had a very nice dinner.\nThe gnocchi was delicious as was the bread.\nThe service was friendly but a little slow (despite the fact you have little buzzers to call for service).\nLocation is also great - right next to dizengoff square.', 'Decent food, good atmosphere. Ordered a cheeseburger which came without cheese, luckily our waitress Tal was excellent and returned it promptly after 2 minutes with cheese. Service is 5 stars because of her, other waiters ignored us when trying to order the check but from inside she saw us struggling and took care of it. Glad she was there as the experience would have been fairly negative if not.'], 'business_name': 'CAFE MAYER'}"
