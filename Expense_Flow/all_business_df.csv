CAFE MAYER,Café Mayer,restaurant,"We had a great experience at Café Mayer in Tel Aviv. The location is central, close to Dizengoff square. The seating was comfortable and not too crowded for a breakfast. The food was delicious and they had vegetarian options which was great. The coffee was also very good. The service was decent and the price was reasonable.
would definitely recommend this place","We stopped by here for a dessert and we enjoyed it fully. On the menu you can order “Something sweet”. As usual we got 2 different options to be able to share and we were very satisfied.

Our selections were - Chocolate fudge with vanilla ice cream and Lemon and Pistachio Pie. The pie was a layered and a very appetizing option. The fudge was hot. Both portions were big enough for two people to share.

The cafe has many tables outside and inside. We decided to take a small table inside by the door. That give us an option of enjoying the light night breeze as well.

The cafe has many options of red and white wines and intriguing salads, shrimp gnocchi and schnitzel and many other appealing options on the menu.

We will definitely try this place again for a meal date, not just dessert.","Amazing service!!
Amazing food!
We started out ordering a bottle of wine , and after that we ordered (with help from the amazing wonderful waiter) amazing dishes. The waiter, Omri, was a part of out outing, always making sure we were happy, gave us shots on the house and then at the end of the evening we ordered a dessert, and because we weren’t 100% happy with the order, gave us another dessert on the house. We had such a wonderful time, we got the Happy Hour discount and some wonderful on the house additions.
The service was so nice , fun, and chill.
We will definitely come back.","This was the first time we ate in Mayer Cafe, and we had a very nice dinner.
The gnocchi was delicious as was the bread.
The service was friendly but a little slow (despite the fact you have little buzzers to call for service).
Location is also great - right next to dizengoff square.","Decent food, good atmosphere. Ordered a cheeseburger which came without cheese, luckily our waitress Tal was excellent and returned it promptly after 2 minutes with cheese. Service is 5 stars because of her, other waiters ignored us when trying to order the check but from inside she saw us struggling and took care of it. Glad she was there as the experience would have been fairly negative if not."
CAFFE CUCU,Café CUCU,restaurant,"Their breakfast/brunch is the best in tel Aviv!!
They have the most unique- French style food. The food itself is super photogenic and it tastes also very good. A really one of a kind cafe in tel Aviv. Their service is also good and their location is great as well(really in the central). If you are looking for a place to sit with friends/family/ work- then this is it!!
The only thing I would recommend is that you should order a place in advance because it could get very packed easily. Also I would recommend not coming on Friday mornings because it is the busiest time of the whole week. Other than that, I would extremely recommend!!","We had our Saturday morning breakfast at the bar of the restaurant. The staff was extremely hospitable and treated us to free shots which was fun and much appreciated. The ambiance and atmosphere at the restaurant was great and we had a good time, the food was good overall but relatively pricey for the amounts. Personally, did not like the croissant with Buche cheese.","We were hungry and the rating was nice, so hopes were high. Benedict was kinda ok but avocado toast somehow didn't have any taste at all. Tea and coffee were bad as well as matcha latte. The place itself is noisy. Staff is nice, but overall a huge disappointment and a ruined breakfast experience for us.","Cafe Cucu in Dizengoff Square, Tel Aviv, is a hidden gem! The coffee is excellent, boasting rich flavors that satisfy any coffee aficionado. The food is equally impressive, with a diverse menu featuring mouthwatering dishes to suit all tastes. From savory to sweet, they've got it all covered. But what truly stands out is their impeccable service - attentive, friendly, and always with a smile. The cozy ambiance adds to the overall experience, making it the perfect spot to relax and indulge in a delightful culinary journey. Highly recommended!","Stellar meal in Tel Aviv!

Each dish better than the last, and such good wine too!

From the moment you walk in and then out again, it's pure horror, as is the dreadful layout, lack of cashiers, just 2 self-service tills and half the products weren't recognized, causing huge delays for assistance. Nothing was working on my last visit. No prices for half the foods, the customer ""service"" section is more like customer Contempt and deli sections are dead slow. You can rename these old ""Co-op/Mega"" stores 50 times but nothing will inject life into the lifeless lot that work there.",After reading some reviews here online I decided to check it out by myself and all I can say is that I came depressed outside. Cashiers were yelling at customers and we were not felt appreciated by the shop if you dont speak their language.

It’s the first time I travel to Israel and the place gave me terrible impression. I was charged for 286 and found out the real price is 160, the driver overcharged me crazily.

Every time I requested Gett to investigate and stop the fraud, they just ignored saying “the drivers are not our employees and we are not responsible..you do as you wish but we are responsible for the fraud”
This is so shameful. I will never want to travel there again, such a terrible place full of frauds!
Shareholders of Gett should fix this problem. Companies with broken value systems will never go any further.","Very bad experience during my last trip to Israel. The price to the airport from Tel Aviv is Nis 150, but Gett driver charged Nis 250.

And the country kicked out Uber so unfortunately you are stuck with this taxi company unless you know how to navigate the buses and trains.,"Gett prepared ""nice"" surprise for ones whose credit card is expired.

I took a taxi ride from raanana to kfar saba during the week and during the day, the counter said 50 when arriving (expensive but expected). I get off the taxi and receive a digital receipt of 80 SHEKELS!!!!!!! The driver tried to rip me off!!!! I contacted their “customer service” through the app and got an answer 3 hours later which was pretty shameful, telling me that there was nothing that could be done unless the driver admitted to this. I didn’t let go and kept on writing them non stop until the girl talking to me finally got a hold of the driver who insisted he mistakenly charged me 80 instead of 60 (wrong again!). I was eventually refunded but felt absolutely disgusted by the entire experience. Turns out gett drivers are often making these “mistakes”. Don’t use this app if you don’t want your money stolen from you. They have so much to learn from competitors."

The french fries were too thin to my liking. You couldn't really taste the potato, it just tasted like oil. The burger was okay, not great.

Maybe it's related to the flavor profile each person likes.","I rarely give 5 stars in my reviews, but every of them honestly: My wife and I liked the desserts and her hot chocolate, but it is normal in all normal cafes, which I give 4 stars... 5 I always keep for something special, not to devalue ""the maximum"" by giving all normal places this 5 stars... And this café, for my taste, deserves 5 because it was the only place in Israel that I visited, where I drank coffee without sugar and I really liked it. I found here exactly the coffee that I could say ""I'll take as usual"". I searched for a long time such coffee, after a vacation in Germany, where I first in my life tasted delicious coffee without sugar and it was not bitter-not sweet.","Great coffee, not much more to say. Just great. The taste of the espresso is not special or sour like other speciality coffees often make, so if you want the classic and perfect, choose this place.
Plus the atmosphere is great and good for working."
אייס/ אוטודיפו- אונל,ACE,home_improvement_store,"Let's start with the real big plus - big parking lot at the entrance for customers only. Makes it much more convenient when planning to purchase big/heavy items that ACE offers... with no time pressure - so you can stroll the store at ease.
Service is a mix. Staff range from very helpful to semi... I overheard a staff member giving great advice to a customer at closet section and another being rather sloppy with guidance and explanation to and older client regarding an emergency light with USB charging option.

I came to pickup online purchase and it went rather smooth... register at front and they send you to the back to pick up. Since it isn't a huge huge store, that was ok. Hence, it isn't one of those HUGE stores that you spend lots of time just to stroll and cover most if the grounds.

There is a decent range of stuff there and sections: closets, garden, painting, home appliances, electricity sockets wires etc etc.... none of these is very large or offer a huge verity - but overall OK and you would find most of what you need for home. If you are looking for departments that has lots and lots of products and options, probebly better to go to a dedicated store (hardware espcially).

Prices are good for some and for other products - less. Id check online for prices of the ACE chain - and if they have what you look for and its just to order and pick up or go and purchase, ACE cinerama is a good spot for this. Showing photos of prices for pillows, which I somewhat was bit surprised to find in ACE...",Good located store. Enough parking spaces available. U find nearly everything concerning gardening and housing here,Nice selection. Clean and bright. Friendly staff.,"They have many small items one may need, which is convenient.
Service - it either took up to 10 minutes looking for an employee to ask a question or waiting while he was busy. Or quite the opposite. Employee came up to me to ask if I needed anything, twice in 3 minutes, when I was actually looking for some data in my mobile. At a cash, although I said explicitly I did not want anything, the cashier still reviewed each one of promoted products. Personally, I will prefer a different place next time.","What can I say? It’s a hardware store. It’s very organized and clean - two of the most important aspects of retail imho. The prices are reasonable. I got a small room heater and a toilet seat (see pic after I installed it myself). Ace has a wide selection and price ranges in both items. The service is good when you get it. Lots of free parking. This branch has an auto depot and an electronic appliances store attached. Selection, cleanliness, reasonable prices - good."

For half a year there have been holes on clothes, I sprayed, changed softening powders and it turns out it's the machine!!!! It ripped through and destroyed our clothes of great value. I called Electra's customer service and told her that some of the clothes are made of sand and clothes are very expensive and what can be done. ""I have no way to help you ma'am"" Terrible customer service and bad products I will not buy from them again","Do not approach the company of messy and liars!!

I arranged a refrigerator technician for yesterday afternoon. After the coordination, they tried to change the visit to the morning hours, some of the attempts were even worthless and fraudulent - one of the representatives called to ""verify"" that we scheduled for the morning hours, and even argued with me. Until I proved in an SMS (which I received from them) that indeed the visit corresponds to rush hours, she did not let go.

At 0900 on the day of the visit, they called me and when I returned to them after about two hours, they said that the technician was on his way and would arrive at the time we had set. At the end of the hours, when the technician did not arrive, I contacted them again and here began a mask of lies that I did not believe I would hear-
First representative - claimed that the technician was not enough to reach me.
Second representative - claimed that the technician was at the address and there was no answer.
The manager of the area, Amit - claimed that the technician did not come to work at all today because he was sick with a sick certificate (what is the relevance of the certificate?!?).
When I presented to a colleague the difference in the versions of the technician's non-arrival from the various representatives, he changed his version in an instant and said that he himself was at the address and there was no answer. I should point out that I am a young, healthy person, and I hear very well both knocks on the door, the ringing of the bell, and the ringing of the phone.. There was no representative at the door, and I was not contacted!

I rescheduled for today - they didn't arrive today either! Two days in a row! In a conversation with a service representative, Mittal, the phone hung up in my face! I was left with a faulty refrigerator that was bought less than a year ago!

Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway - my time is important! It is not possible to underestimate a client's time like this, even more so when there was continuous communication from my side.

Regret buying from them, will not purchase any product from them in the future and suggest you all stay away","Simple service on the face!!!
I coordinated an air conditioning technician after the air conditioner decided not to work
The technician arrived after a few days ""fixed"" left the house and the air conditioner once again did not turn on.
I called them and since the technician did not close the call, they had no way to help me, they asked me to call back after an hour
I called after an hour they refused to send me another technician and the technician who was there was not ready to come back.
The eighth month of pregnancy should not go through such turmoil. I brought in a private technician within two hours after the incident who replaced a damaged part that your same technician supposedly ""repaired"" and the air conditioner works fine.
Save yourself the headache and bring a private technician who are simply not worth a minute of your time!  Especially since I waited several days without air conditioning at home!
Disappointed in the levels.","Worst customer service I have ever received. Deceiving and justifying instead of giving normal service to the customer. Crazy lack of response on the phone

באוליג רמת גן/ ראשלצ,Bowling Ramat Gan,bowling_alley,"An amazing place for kids, families, group outings and dates. Lots of game machines, with a ticket master machine. Basic food, alcohol, soft drinks and hot drinks. Parking in front of the place.","Probably the best bowling alley that I've been to in a long time. The lanes are really flat, allowing a better, and more consistent game. The place also allows you to choose whether to enable/disable guarding rails per player.","It's just near Ramat Gan's stadium. The staff is friendly and accommodating, making for a pleasant experience that is always appreciated. One of the main advantages of this alley is that there is plenty of parking nearby, making it simple to get to and from the alley.

There are, however, a few disadvantages to consider. The alley can get rather congested in the evenings, resulting in considerable waiting time. This can be aggravating for individuals who prefer to bowl without interruptions. Furthermore, the alley does not take same-day appointments, which is a bummer for those looking to arrange a last-minute adventure.

The alley itself is likewise on the small side, with only 15 lanes. Overall, it's a good option for a night of bowling, and there are no better options in the vicinity. Recommended for its convenient location and helpful personnel, but be prepared for unexpected crowds and a lack of reservation alternatives.

My first time ever ""Bowling"" experience in my whole life  happened here and I so much enjoyed it. 'twas a treat from my company where I work for. (01-02-2023)","Nice bowling place.

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. During the evening hours, the alley can get quite crowded, leading to some waiting time. This can be frustrating for those who want to enjoy a night of bowling without any delays. Additionally, the alley does not accept same-day reservations, which is disappointing for those who want to plan a last-minute outing.

One is ""half dead"", and this one. And I am very glad that such a surprising lack of competition in such a place has not affected the quality of what it offers to its customers.

Not bad, not good, but just ok. But the prices and taste of the food is quite good.
And most of all, my wife and I liked the main feature of this place. It extremely fits to that place(a large park): ""picnic sets"". My wife and I thought about just trying something to eat, not hoping for anything special, but we were very pleasantly surprised in the end. For 200 shekels, we got a box with quite good different fillings and another one with ... well, in general, you can see it on the photos. Salads, on big and two smaller with different tastes, buns, sauces, pancake, juices. It was set for two. we ate it there, and took the second box home for dinner, so we can say that you can buy it for two meals. As for a picnic snack, it is quite suitable.","249 shekels for a picnic-style breakfast, not even coffee included.
We ate our fill, but breakfast is given to you in a large cardboard box. And if you want to take an eco-basket and a blanket, then it costs another 40 shekels!  Why not take a deposit and give a basket for free for an hour?
This is a very Israeli place: a lot of food with a bun, very expensive, a lot of people.
Regular Benedict is 1000 times better.  The idea is good, but the execution is sad. ""There are no competitors in the area, so we won't even try.""","The food was very tasty, but the wait time quite bad. We ordered and got an estimation of 12:20.

The restaurant was nearly empty.
Sat outside and at some point my 2 year old started crying, as toddlers often do. I was trying to calm her down softly and after 2-3 mins a lady named Rania (looked like a shift leader) approached me telling me it bothers other diners.
Fuming, as any parent would, I asked her if she wants me to leave. She showed no empathy or understanding and just repeated it bothers other diners (place nearly empty, no one complained) and suggested I try other methods of soothing my baby.
This is another level of pretence and rudeness. Assuming the lady herself does not like children or knows anything about parenting.
My baby stopped crying shortly after she left and another lovely young waitress approached us with an apologetic look and ice cream we haven't ordered in order to ""compensate for what happened"" - an initiative I'm assuming did not come from her manager Rania as we received no further words from her nor a goodbye when leaving.

Although prices are a bit high, the owner and the workers are very nice & chill, they have a wide variety of products, and also have a small bakery where they make fresh pastries every day. On top of that, they can make sandwiches for you if you ask them from the wide variety of meats & cheeses they have there (although you can't put both dairy and meat sadly) on top of some vegetables and sauces. They also do deliveries to the neighborhood, and the music they put in the background gives a very nice atmosphere to the place.","Really nice to find a small store with everything in the middle of a neighborhood.

The selection is lacking only in the field of soft drinks. This morning I got there and there was no regular Coca Cola but only Coke Zero and Diet Coke, and there is never any RC Cola or Pepsi.

מקום בלב שלנו,Makom Balev,restaurant,"We came on a Friday morning, the place was very nice and we really liked the vibes. Service was good and food was also nice, though I would say the salmon and egg dish(the almost egg Benedict) was quite small for the price. The red shakshuka dish was very filling. I would recommend try this place (and better to book in advance)",September 2024 had a family celebration at Makom Balev. Great location with lots of atmosphere. Very attentive people who responded to our every request during the event itself. A lovely event manager. Pleasant people to deal with. Certainly added to the success of the event. Oh and by the way - food was great - tasty and lots of it. Happy to recommend it to anyone wanting a place for a celebration.,"I know this place in Raanana for years. Recently, there was a change in (actually an addition to) owners' structure. Went to see what changed. Unfortunately, didn't come out encouraged.
The place looks the same, the ambience is laid-back, distance between seating places is good.
However, the quality of food, from the unpleasant smell of burned oil on which omelet was fried, the look and feel of a not-so-fresh salmon, and even the quality of (usually bulletproof) crack-pie were disappointing. The only good dish was a market salad;)
Yet, Adam, who served us, with his charming smile and a professional service, somewhat compensated the disappointment (the score reflects additinal star due to him). Also want to mention Lia, the hostess, who was professional and accomodating.
The prices are too high for the quality and appearance of the food.
This place can be a jewel with it location and potential once the quality is greatly improved.
I'll wait for it to become such.
Value for your money - very low.","Great great atmosphere, a gem in Ra’anana!
The food is good, the pizza of the North is super recommended!

I bought cauliflower about three days ago for NIS 20 per unit (they don't sell by weight but by unit which is absurd, the smallest or largest is 20 NIS and this is misleading).  The cauliflower is full of mold, flies and worms, completely rotten.
Saves you the picture","I happened to be passing by Achuza Street in Ra'anana and saw the Tana HaFrey vegetable store, I asked the nice seller if they have a website and they make deliveries to Ra'anana, he answered in the affirmative.
Today on 12.04.2022 I made a shipment of vegetables and they arrived today! Fast delivery, vegetables of the best, hard, strong, with muscles, beautiful vegetables, fresh and sweet, and most importantly very clean, I came to write a review for them and saw a score of 4.7 friends, it's not just 4.7 the surfers vote with their hands, and when the service is good and of high quality and the vegetables that come to you are of good quality and then What wonder the score is like that.

After one of the worst shopping experiences in the supermarket chains that chose rotten vegetables for me, really rotten and disgusting, I switched to regular orders at Tana Heferi, the price is really great, and it would be good if they put a checkout on the website, it would make the purchase process easier even though cash is also great.

Two friends and I found this place by chance and were happy with our luck.

The vegan menu is abundant and creative.

I ordered the beet burger with potatoes. The burger itself wasn’t as flavorful as I had hoped, the buns weren’t toasted and the potatoes weren’t as golden brown as I like, but the dish was fine.

It took a while for the food to arrive and it seems like a recurring issue in this establishment.

The service was friendly and courteous, but once the food was served, we turned invisible.

The music of choice was fine, except it was quite repetitive and monotonous.

Whatever this restaurant lacks it makes up for with a cool ambiance and great clientele.

The seating is outdoor. The tables are quite small for the size of the dishes.

One of my friends was celebrating a birthday, but the restaurant didn’t have a sparkler. No biggy.

This is a place you go to to chill out in a cool ambiance, not for the service or food (which are fine).

Someone should teach the management about the relationship between clean bathrooms and appetite. Because of the amount of clientele, the bathrooms need tending to more often.

All in all - a good experience.","RUN RUN RUN that fine place is it gonna wait for you sorry for my late blooming but you are going to enjoy there!!

The only thing that really spoiled our night out at Soho was the tremendous noise in the restaurant from all the people sitting around you, it’s really sounds like birds chirping at sunset and it’s kinda unbearable, there must be something off with the acoustics of that place as we’ve been before at fully packed restaurants but never experienced that type of noise.

The prices are a bit higher than average HOWEVER the dishes were absolutely amazing, the sushi was original, delicious and with generous proportions of fish and other ingredients. The Wok I ordered was extremely in a large proportion. As a matter of fact it was the first time in my life that I wasn't able to finish the dish despite how hard I tried - once again absolutely delicious! The main downside for the restaurant was that the staff can be... Very slow... Even when you're actually trying to pay or simply waiting for your credit card to return. Overall a great place, would definitely come again",Each dish came with fresh ingredients and tasted very well. The cocktails are great and the service is very fast.,"This Asian fusion restaurant perfectly understands its own niche and delivers trendy dishes with high quality ingredients. I live in Chicago and it’s easy to find a club/lounge with sushi and noodle dishes that are sloppily prepared or over-processed. Soho provides the atmosphere for a fun night out without missing the mark on the food. Ingredients like steak are thoughtfully sourced, fish is fresh, and flavors are balanced. Highly recommend the pad Thai with ribeye and truffle oil."

It's a shame the city of Tel Aviv behaves like this.
The exhibit was about the systematic use of contact centers (מרכזי קשר) by the state of Israel. It illustrated the horror that the thousands of children have to go through each year after vein systematically cut off their fathers in the state off Israel and particularly in Tel Aviv.
As a form of engaged art the exhibition was censored since the city of tel aviv provides funding for the cinémathèque and also runs a contact center where about a thousand children are forced to see their dad in a cage.

4 stars because what I was really looking for was really overpriced... I bought shapes for baking cookies, in the shape of a star (10.90) and a cloud (19.90), and I also wanted in the shape of some animal (39.90 Shekel!!!). There are sets a little cheaper but not in the shapes I wanted.

The prices are listed in brackets, you can get an impression of what I'm talking about from the pictures.

I didn't test other products, and again, the salespeople really helped me and were super nice.","Last Wednesday evening, I purchased a silicon pancake pan with indentations. Not a quarter of an hour had passed, and my handle broke/fell off. I returned to the store, and turned to the nice seller who sold it to me, asking to exchange it (I didn't even ask for money back). I answered in the negative. ""The product left the store intact. Why don't you cut it with scissors or pull really hard?!"".
I replied to her that I have no interest in cutting with scissors a product that I am interested in (something that seems obvious to me). very. I also told her that it was probably the ""fatigue of the material"" (a term she didn't know... and thought I was making it up).
In conclusion, she did not give an alternative product. Rude and accusatory behavior. There are toilets. And put me in an unpleasant place in front of the other visitors to the store.
I would expect from such a large and successful chain, to be more helpful.. certainly for a product that costs NIS 29.90 (it's a shame I didn't buy it for NIS 5 at Ali Express.. we are screwed for the desire to make a living here in Israel).
I will not buy there again.. and recommend to the rest as well.",I really like the store. It has almost everything in the field of cooking and baking.,Unpleasant service. I asked the seller for advice and she laughed at the question. The place is suitable for those who know exactly what they need.,"On Thursday I purchased equipment and materials for baking a cake for my two-year-old son for NIS 400, it turned out that I only used most of the materials and I returned on Monday to return some of the materials (several packages of candy
dry colors and food colors) everything is closed and undamaged.

The salespeople at the store (Givataim Mall branch) immediately said no, and when I explained that it was really a pity about the materials, and everything was valid for another six months, and during the sale they did not draw my attention for a moment to a small sign saying that it is not possible to return, they said that it doesn't matter.
While I was trying to ask (after all, only 3 days had passed and the expense was large) they interrupted me and only said ""let us explain to you"" and even added that the customer was not right...

It's a shame that 100 shekels should lose reputation and make a person feel so unpleasant, after spending a lot of money in this store every year on kitchen equipment and various products.

Dudu Ivri, the owner, who's Iraqi parents started the farm back in the 80s, is a great friendly guy. He steps through the tables and ensures every one is enjoying their meal and always open to improve. All orders are delivered in take away boxes and it's a self service, so you can enjoy them while visiting the park or in your trip somewhere else. Note that the parking is several hundreds meters far and you'll need to climb your way to the place. I enjoyed the fresh baked calazone made in the Tabun stove. Prices are somewhat higher than average but the quality products are fresh and tasty. Arrive early on Fridays if you would like to avoid the long wait.

Staff 👨‍🍳 is friendly and service is relatively quick! I wish I came here more often!","Tamara is a great place when you want something sweet and fresh.

You can choose your ice-cream or yogurt and then top it off with lot's of goodies from the big selection on display. There's also a big selection of locally made, fruit-based popsicles and other fruit-based deserts.","The best frozen yogurt in the city!!
Probably all over the county.
Always fresh toppings, smiley and quick service, sauces’ diversity. Definitely my favorite one, in spite of varieties around","One of the best places to eat healthy and tasty.
Frozen yogurt, tapioca cream, ice cream, fruit salad are some of the options, normally made with low sugar, low fat and still tasty.
For frozen yogurt you can choose all the toppings they have, so it depends on you to keep it low sugar, cause they serve also some chocolate, jams and other high sugar as topping."
דלק מנטה מחלף זיכרון,Delek Zikhron Ya'akov Interchange,gas_station,"This is kind of resting stop for driver and passenger who travel from tel Aviv to qiryat shmona by bus and for others too. Rest room is available inside the shop. Little costly price fixed for water bottles, cookies etc.","Nce place to refill your gas and pick a few essentials.

There's a good McDonald's outlet on the premises with great options. The toilets are good too.

It's an unusually large gas outlet. The view of the hills from the gas outlet should not be missed. The road by the outlet is not a very busy one i.e. you may not encounter heavy traffic on it. But vehicles ply on it at high speeds.

Best of luck.","Gas station in a very centered place , just before you get on the high way , usually crowded, especially in the morning, you can stop to a quick shop in their grocery store or get something to eat in Mc'donalds",One of the Best Falafel in Israel (and in the world) is just next to this gas station - amazing tastes and owner/seller  persinality,the self service fuel pump fails to read the credit card. the onscreen instructions are unhelpful and no printed instructions are posted
זיו שוורצמן,משק שוורצמן,food_store,"Great selection of quality vegetables, fruits, grains, non-wheat flours, chocolate, olive oils. A few kinds of nuts are available, including macadamia, but the best are the local pecans. Occasionally items which are not local, like Thai coconuts. The asparagus is not organic and is labeled so. There's a refrigerated section, which I don't shop, but I think they sell cheeses. Some of the staff are hipsters, but all are friendly, and the boss is always friendly.","Produce is top notch, good selection of other organic products. The bread is highly recommended. Personnel are always happy! Don't mind the fruit flies,  they are happy too 😉 the only bad thing about this place is that they don't deliver anymore 😒","I am a customer for quite some time.
I can say that it is a pleasure to be a customer of Ziv and his team, or more likely his family.
The service is top, the atmosphere is a charm, the goods are of quality.
Most recommended","If you care about what you eat, this is the place 4 u, organic, self grown products with the nicest stuff you can find",Very soulful place!!
ירוק עד- מרכולית בית,משתלות ירוק עד,store,"Worst service ever: people there are rude and take a pleasure in ignoring you. I can’t speak to the quality of their products, since their lack of customer service prevented me from finding what I needed. The one star is because Google doesn’t let you give zero.",Probably the best place I have been to to buy plants,Really nice and attentive staff members. Well worth the visit.,Price are good even in the day before the holiday,"Pleasant and friendly staff, Rafi helped me patiently and professionally, prices written in advance for a large part of the selection, which in my eyes is the most important."
מלון בית אורן,"Selina Mantur Beit Oren סלינה מנתור, בית אורן",hotel,"Overall, the place is highly overrated. While the premises are pleasant and tranquil, with a magnificent view, ample seating areas, and a welcoming atmosphere, the accommodations are rudimentary. Despite the agreement stating otherwise, there was no refrigerator, the air conditioning was inadequate (unable to be turned off and emitting foul-smelling air), and the cleanliness was substandard. The breakfast is very basic, and the on-site bar and restaurant are overpriced. For more than 1,000 NIS per night on weekends, I expected much more, even in Israel","Looking for this place on google maps after our stay, I was shocked to find out that it has 4.3 stars.
We stayed there for 2 nights with 2 kids, (3 and 1.4 YO) over the weekend, we booked 1 room with breakfasts.

I'll start from the price - super expensive for what you get. For that price you can get a 5 star luxury hotel in prime locations in Israel (and this is definitely not a prime location).

Regarding the rooms - poor maintenance, we did not pull up the sheets, but the beds themself that were made of fabric, probably got wet at some point because there were disgusting brown signs of some liquid on them.
Shower was basic.
Also, there are no keys to the rooms. There is a numbers pad that is working on batteries I guess.. sometime it took a few attempts until it worked. Seems like batteries were low or something like that.

Breakfast - very basic, not tasty, dirty dishes.

Also, the overall maintenance of the place is not good.. chairs are peeling off, mattresses and couches that lay outside are not clean.

The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because of the nice views you get by staying at this place.

Putting it all together, for 903 ILS per night!!!, I wont recommend this place for anyone.
Sorry I had to write such a bad review but that's the truth, I hope it'll help them improve.","We reserved a family suite for two nights at the total cost of $1,400 (about 4,400 shekels). The room description included a minibar, kitchenette, and coffee, as well as a jacuzzi. When we arrived, there was a mini-fridge and a coffee maker, no other kitchen-like items. The jacuzzi was not working, and only after inquiring twice, we were told that ""it was a known problem"" (it seems none of the Jacuzzis work on this property). This was a disappointment to us, considering the price point of this room ($700/night!!) Additionally, the shower was not enclosed, so we needed to use a mop every time we showered to avoid water leaking into the room. Likewise, breakfast was not served on time because staff didn't show up.

At the end of our stay and following several conversations with the management, Beit Oren offered us 25% towards our next stay, which was a stay we had booked following this stay at another Selina location. The manager assured us that she had entered the price adjustment into the system, but when we got to the other location, they were not aware of the discount.

When we tried to address this issue, Beit Oren was unresponsive at first. Only after numerous calls and texts, we were able to finally get a hold of them, we were told that general manager decided to renege on the promise to provide us with 25% off at our next booked location, stating  we could have a 25% voucher for ""future stays"", meaning only if we booked another stay with Selina within 12 months.

In light of our experience, we do not plan to book future stays with Selina and would recommend that others avoid Selina properties.","We arrived for one night. The setting is beautiful, up on the Carmel mountain, with views to the mediterranean and beautiful sunset. The communal areas are chic and the gardens well tended and inviting. I loved that they're pet friendly and our dog had a bed and bowels ready for him.
BUT - this is hardly a hotel. The rooms are very basic, beds not so comfortable, very old fashioned decor and more of a youth hostel level. We arrived Friday afternoon and were very hungry but there was nothing to eat at the bar (""open 8am-10pm""), they were out of decaff coffee (still out at breakfast) and we had to wait hungry for almost 3 hours for the retaurant kitchen to open- this at a location with no other way to get something to eat but drive for at least 20 minutes.
Breakfast was nice but not a huge variety. As this was priced at about 450$ per room- I think they have a lot to improve to justify that price","Pastorally and absolutely beautiful!
Great atmosphere, and location.
Rooms were less than expected, I took one of the suites, and have seen nicer showers in prison than the one in my room.
Gracefully complaining to the front desk resulted in them offering me a mop."
"ממפיס פ""ת",ממפיס Memphis,hamburger_restaurant,"A surprisingly good hamburger! I asked for medium and received a perfectly medium hamburger! This is quite an achievement in some places :)
The hamburger bun wasn't soggy at all and was fresh and tyasty without overwhelming the hamburger.
This is a place for hamburger purists, no special fancy crazy additions to the hamburger, just the basic toppings to choose from.
The fries were also a surprising MVP. Definitely freshly fried, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

Will definitely be coming back again (and again)!","Food is good, service not as much.

I really enjoy having my lunch gateways at Memphis, but unfortunately the service (cooking and order management) is bad. You can easily wait 20-30 minutes for your meal, whatever it will be.
Only if you stand at the counter with impatient face and waving hands then something starts to move…

Hope it will get better in the future!","Fantastic food, amazing service great place!! You should come","Solid burger but I've had better. But better is not kosher and I guess that's why because in my opinion the non kosher meat is better. However this was still a good burger, but not great like you can get at other places in Tel Aviv. It makes me glad I am not kosher haha","I was sitting with friends on Thursday (very busy) and the owner of the place approached me specifically 3 times with all kinds of questions that took me out of my peace!  I almost walked out on him in front of everyone.  He touched my plate and wanted to address me saying ""Are you finished?""  While I eat from it!  We sat down a group of girls, and he wanted to seat more customers. He wanted to kick us out for them.  A no-wow experience at all, the food barely passed through the throat.  My experience is that we got food and we couldn't sit there at our leisure and talk!  And the prices are high anyway, so why don't we sit in our own circle?!  Why does he need to enter our conversations and plate?  Such audacity!!!"

Parking near restaurants is not always available, and we park on visitor parking 5 min walk .","Not only the meat is important... expensive,not so tasty,severe choices,terrible acoustics,needs urgent renovation even when trying to give an ambient of old/country/artistic place,bad cleaning and maintenance including toilets,in and out seats in balcony,handicap and children friendly,good service,not kosher,reservation preferable specially on weekends,enough parking,before meal enjoy around the settlement.I don't think will visit again,it was disappointed after visiting few times in the past and giving an extra chance to improve.","The food was really good, but the portions were a little bit small, after spending a lot of money we expected to finish the lunch more full. I wanted to give the restaurant 4 stars but after hearing that giving them 5 stars will get us some kind of treat, I felt that it is only fair to take 1 star down.",Excellent Argentinian steakhouse. Food is served in a very attractive plating. Meat is superb. Side dishes are excellent. Service ids friendly and helpful though a little slow. Highly recommended,"WOW
We’ve arrived for lunch after taking a tour of the lovely artist village in Which the restaurant is located.
The food was superb with mouth watering slices of meat that are hard to find in Israel.
Service is excellent and the restaurant itself gives the impression of an Argentinian farm (in the best way possible:-))"
רשות הטבע והגנים חי,Hai-Bar Nature Reserve,park,"You can almost touch the vultures.
Being back from Gamla Nature Reserve, I had visited the week before, and being still disappointed by the missing vultures (none left, a pity), I couldn't be more surprised to find vultures so close to me in this park.
I do recommend visiting this place as they are free to fly wherever they want, they are not in a cage.
The other animals that are here are just waiting to be released free when they'll be able to survive.
This place is a must!
And as with most of the Natural reserves and National parks, it would be wise to reserve your tickets in advance on their site.","Very nice. Not a lot to walk. If arrive early plenty of parking even in the shade. You can see wild goats and sheep, dear and all those types of horned animals. The view is fascinating, located near the haifa university. Very cosy. The highlight is the griffon vultures. Some are in cages, but if you are lucky you can see them flying above. Recommended for everyone, including families with little children.",A good place to spend your weekend. A short walk around the reserve. Half a day is sufficient to complete the visit  . Cost of the entry ticket is 22 nis. There was a  short movie explaining the background of hai bar reserve.There are deers and vultures. Kids will enjoy the place.,Very nice and peaceful place.  Animals and birds.  Quite nature.  Compatible with kids. Parking nearby.  Restroom.,"Great place to visit and see different animal goats / vultures / eagle

When you come down, you automatically look down, right? And you see yourself touching the ground. Your brain instinctively reacts to the approach of the floor and prepares your muscles to stop. Yes, but that's when the surprise comes. The elevator goes further down. Then it's like an electric shock. You won't even realize what happened, the next level is already coming. It's quite invigorating.","Nice people, spectacular place, but not open to the public.",Their coffee is delicious,Definitely a must visit.,very beautiful

atmosphere of interior is amazing. we loved this pub!!
you can sit both inside and outside on the street. so going here and enjoy :)","It's not perfect, but generally very nice. I have been here many times and will come back again. The place has a really nice atmosphere/vibe, with the kind of decor you'd expect from an Irish pub in a foreign country.

The food is mostly good, with the fish & chips, Irish sausages and some other dishes being better than average. The chicken shishliks (""swords"") aren't that great. They also have a good draught beer selection (though they won't give you a 0.5 Maredsous because they only have the 0.3 glass, or something). Surprisingly it has one of the best dessert selections for a pub. The ""bread pudding"" is really great.

Service is pretty standard – not outstanding, but I've never had issues. Prices are fair, about what you'd expect.","Food is mediocre, so not five stars. Reminder for myself - girl do not order fish and chips, you barely found fish in it last time. Other than that - nice pub, good service.",Food and beer are both amazing. Great service and warm people. I constantly visit this place because the atmosphere is so good! Strongly recommended!,"There was a good menu of Alcohol and a moderate menu of food. The bar was designed with a special style dedicated to Oscar wilde (an Irish poet and playwright). The place is quite big. The staff is quite representative and offered a good explanation of the food, menu and different tasting. Unfortunately, the staff did a mistake regarding our bil, they didn't return a friend of mine 100 nis - by mistake of course; they corrected themselves."

I have somthing to tell you hunny,"Headquarters of the national lottery operations, nothing to do there unless you won the lottery :)","The building is in a relatively old area of ​​the city in its north-central direction, currently as of February 2022 the place looks like one big construction site, and there are several projects at the same time that create a lot of noise and dust.
The building is old, dusty and not aesthetic at all.
The elevator is small and cramped.
The security guards in the lobby are behind transparent glass and it is difficult to get their attention (to go upstairs you have to go through them).
The building is gray and sleepy. Quite boring and there is no arranged parking nearby. There is a municipal parking lot nearby, always full and very crowded.
In short, there is much room for improvement.","Spectacular place for lucky winners...
I visited to find out if I won. Oops I didn't win.
